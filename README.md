## Inspiration: 
A lot of patients have rebounds in the hospital due to their chronic conditions because they don't keep up to date with their vital sign and symptom progressions, difficulty keeping up with their health or difficulty reaching their healthcare provider. Medilink allows patients to stay up to date with their vital signs, get reminders to monitor manual input symptoms and vital signs, methods to help alleviate their symptoms and bring their vital signs back to their normal ranges,etc. All while providing them a community to anonymously reach out to other anonymous patients on the platform with similar symptoms and backgrounds. On the provider's end, it allows providers to instantaneously get notified of their patient's distress signals, extreme discrepancies in their patient's vitals, scheduling appointments, etc. 

## What it does: 
It allows patient's link their wearables (e.g. apple watches, fitbit, etc.) to their portal which is also linked to their provider's profile, allowing their provider to have access to their at-home daily vitals, recent distress signals, etc.
Patient's can send messages to their provider preceding their next checkup allowing the provider to have accurate and immediate records of their symptoms. Patients can link up with other patients with the same conditions or symptoms as them and similar backgrounds so they can have anonymous accountability partners

## How we built it: 
---Used figma for the actual API portion for what we want the website to look like
---Created and used notepad for displaying the data for both the DOCTOR and PATIENT button, the data is simplified but it shows how the user would enter their information 
---Used GitHub for collaboration, but all html data was saved to the BisonByte_25.html for it display/open on chrome

## Challenges we ran into:
----formatting the tables so it;'s readable
----displaying the screen to where the user wouldn't get confused for what to put for their information 
----for the backend portion having set ideas for the symptoms and the onsets, but didn't have time to merge the two together 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We brainstormed through different tracks and came up with an idea we're proud of
We created an aesthetic website while figuring out how to store data
We learned how to grab items from GitHub while working on every item individually and seamlessly
We communicated and worked well together

## What we learned:
We learnt how to use Figma to create aesthetic displays

## What's next for Medilink:
Next for MediLink is expanding its capabilities by integrating more health tracking devices and wearables to provide a broader range of health data. We plan to enhance the platform with advanced AI algorithms to analyze patients' health patterns, offering predictive insights and personalized recommendations. Additionally, we aim to scale the peer support network, connecting patients globally to foster community-driven wellness. Security and privacy enhancements will also be prioritized to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations, giving both patients and providers peace of mind.
